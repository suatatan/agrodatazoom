## 🌍 About This Project

As a data scientist based in Canada, I am deeply passionate about addressing one of humanity's most critical challenges: **global food security and sustainable agriculture**. This repository serves as a comprehensive analytical platform for exploring agricultural trends, food production patterns, and food security indicators across all countries worldwide.

The agricultural sector faces unprecedented challenges due to climate change, population growth, and geopolitical factors. Through data-driven insights and visualizations, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of global agricultural dynamics and support evidence-based decision-making in food policy and agricultural development.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Global Coverage**: Analyze agricultural and food security data from all countries worldwide
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify long-term trends in agricultural production, trade, and consumption
- **Food Security Assessment**: Evaluate food security indicators and vulnerability patterns
- **Comparative Studies**: Cross-country comparisons of agricultural performance and policies
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to forecast agricultural outcomes and food security risks
- **Visual Storytelling**: Create compelling visualizations to communicate complex agricultural data

## 📊 Data Sources

This project integrates data from multiple authoritative sources:

### 🇹🇷 Turkey (Starting Point)
- **TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute)**: Official agricultural statistics, crop production, livestock data
- Coverage: Production volumes, cultivated areas, yield rates, agricultural trade

### 🌐 International Sources
- **FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)**: Global food security and agricultural statistics
- **World Bank**: Agricultural development indicators and rural statistics
- **USDA**: Global agricultural production and trade data
- **OECD**: Agricultural policy and market data
- **National Statistical Offices**: Country-specific detailed agricultural data
